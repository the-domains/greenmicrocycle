This is The Green Microcycle Plus from The Green Microgym. It's a bike. It's an electric bike. And it's an electricity generator.

It goes up on this stand and the electric bike motor becomes a generator. You can make anywhere from 30 watts (easy) to 100 watts (a workout).

The electricity can be stored in a battery or go right back into the building via a normal wall outlet.
